    </p>

    <p>Hello! I’m Pratikkumar Arvindbhai Solanki, a passionate and dedicated tech enthusiast currently pursuing the Mobile Solutions Development program at Conestoga College, Canada. My journey began with a Bachelor's in Computer Applications (BCA), where I built a strong foundation in programming, web development, and database management, graduating with distinction and an 8.70 CGPA.

    During my BCA, I worked on several academic projects, including a Vehicle Breakdown Management System and an Online Book Store. These projects not only helped me improve my coding and analytical thinking but also deepened my interest in building real-world applications. I also worked as an IELTS tutor, which strengthened my communication and leadership skills.

    After moving to Canada.</p> <p> I began exploring mobile and web development in more depth. Currently, I’m advancing my skills in technologies like C#, ASP.NET MVC, Swift (iOS), Android (Kotlin), SQL/SQLite, and Git/GitHub. I’ve built and contributed to projects such as CoffeeShot, a review platform built with ASP.NET MVC, and Travel Buddy, an iOS trip planning app using Core Data, MapKit, and the OpenWeather API.

    
        <p>I am now actively seeking a Co-op position where I can apply my technical knowledge, work in a collaborative environment, and continue growing as a developer. I bring not only technical skills but also a strong work ethic, adaptability, and a constant desire to learn.

        If you’re looking for a motivated developer with a solid foundation and real project experience, feel free to connect!
    </p>
